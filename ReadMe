For the construction of this project, Rest Assured was used with junit. 
To run, just open any terminal and type mvn test. 
But for that it is necessary to install mvn. If you choose to run via junit, select the ApiTest file and run via junit. 
In the project in question there are 3 test scenarios, which are: mustSendInvalidRequest, mustSendInexistedKeyword, mustReceiveData.
